## Data Analysis Project

This project utilises Python with Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib to work with a Kaggle dataset containing data about competitors in powerlifting competitions.

After filtering and cutting down the dataset to 30k competitors a series of graphs are created to demonstrate unique
relationships found between specific characteristics of the competitors.

These graphs are then analysed in the AnalysisOfGraphs.pdf
