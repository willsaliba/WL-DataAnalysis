## Data Analysis Project

This project utilises Python with Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib to work with a Kaggle dataset containing data about competitors in powerlifting competitions.

Using the powerlifting data set, a series of graphs are created to demonstrate unique
relationships found between specific characteristics of the competitors.

These graphs are then analysed in the AnalysisOfGraphs.pdf

Note that while the original dataset contained 1.5 million competitors the graphs displayed in this project are from the first 30,000 rows of the dataset
because my current computer is fairly weak.
